# BackupScript
Simple script to remotely copy and erase files

I made it for copying my backups on my laptop to my raspberrypi...but use it for whatever

just edit to your usage


Connects to remote -> Copy from remote to local -> cleans out the remote folder (keeps the directory there)

I reccomend setting up SSH keys so you dont need to input your password
